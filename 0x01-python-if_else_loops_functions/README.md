# 0x01. Python - if/else, loops, functions
An introductory project on:
- How to use the `if`, `if ... else` statements
- How to use comments
- How to affect values to variables
- How to use the `while` and `for` loops
- How Python’s `for` different from C‘s
- How to use the `break` and `continues` statements
- How to use `else` clauses on loops
- What the `pass` statement does, and when to use it
- How to use `range`
- Functions and how to use them
- What functions without `return` statements return
- Variable scope
- Tracebacks
- Arithmetic operators and how to use them

## Requirements
- python 3.4
- pep8 1.7
## File Descriptions
### Mandatory
**[0-positive_or_negative.py](./0-positive_or_negative.py)** - This program will assign a random signed number to the variable `number` each time it is executed. Complete the [source code](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/2S3G4vOnRrWymCjKYd6Wew) in order to print whether the number stored in the variable `number` is positive or negative.
  - The variable `number` will store a different value every time you run this program
  - The output of the program should be:
    - The number, followed by:
      - if the number is greater than 0: `is positive`
      - if the number is 0: `is zero`
      - if the number is less than 0: `is negative`
    - followed by a new line
**[1-last_digit.py](./1-last_digit.py)** - This program will assign a random signed number to the variable `number` each time it is executed. Complete the [source code](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/e9k9---MJXcMmIjlMdlBpw) in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable `number`.
  - The variable `number` will store a different value every time you run this program
  - The output of the program should be:
    - The string `Last digit of`, followed by
    - the number, followed by
    - the string `is`, followed by
      - if the number is greater than 5: the string `and is greater than 5`
      - if the number is 0: the string `and is 0`
      - if the number is less than 6 and not 0: the string `and is less than 6 and not 0`
    - followed by a new line
**[2-print_alphabet.py](./2-print_alphabet.py)** - Write a program that prints the alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line.
  - You can only use one `print` function with string format
  - You can only use one loop in your code
  - You are not allowed to store characters in a variable
  - You are not allowed to import any module
**[3-print_alphabt.py](./3-print_alphabt.py)** - Write a program that prints the alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line.
  - Print all the letters except `q` and `e`
  - You can only use one `print` function with string format
  - You can only use one loop in your code
  - You are not allowed to store characters in a variable
  - You are not allowed to import any module
**[4-print_hexa.py](./4-print_hexa.py)** - Write a program that prints all numbers from 0 to 98 in decimal and in hexadecimal (as in the following example)
  - You can only use one `print` function with string format
  - You can only use one loop in your code
  - You are not allowed to store numbers or strings in a variable
  - You are not allowed to import any module
  - Example:
  ```
  0 = 0x0
  ...
  10 = 0xa
  ...
  98 = 0x62
  ```

**[8-uppercase.py](./8-uppercase.py)** - 
**[9-print_last_digit.py](./9-print_last_digit.py)** - 
**[10-add.py](./10-add.py)** - 
**[11-pow.py](./11-pow.py)** - 
**[12-fizzbuzz.py](./12-fizzbuzz.py)** - 
### Advanced
